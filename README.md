Welcome to Le Bouqet!  

This React.js front-end application utilizes an Express.js back-end with SQL to retrieve and display information 
about a selection of some of the flowers that Le Bouquet has in stock. The application makes API calls to the back-end to 
fetch the necessary data and presents it in an intuitive user interface built with React.js. The goal is to provide
users with access to detailed information about these flowers, allowing them to explore and discover a simple but dynamic ux/ui design.
